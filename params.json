{"name":"Android Tool Kit","tagline":"The ATK","body":"### The tool you need!!!\r\n\r\nThis started as a small project back last year with my DNA which then evolved into just a big tool. I wanted this to become big and more useful and maybe it will! I'll actually work on this time to time and others can help too.\r\n```\r\nYou don't need to do anything special\r\nJust download a release and use\r\nIf there is bugs, report! \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Helping out\r\n\r\nIf you want to help out with ATK just submit a pull request BUT in case coding isn't your thing then sharing the word helps. Thats about it thx\r\n\r\n### Contributors\r\na\r\nCurrently as of 6/20/14 8:56pm I've been the only one working on this, but this has work from others as well. I'll end up putting thanks here soon, no worrys.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n\r\nIf you ever want to contact me for some reason, the best bet is twitter ([@covxx](https://twitter.com/covxx) always). I have an XDA,g+,facebook,myspace,reddit, and everything else but twitter is still the best way to contact me.
