Android Tool Kit in 329 lines of code
------------------
A bunch of stuff I use(d) since 2013, thought it'd be cool to have an open tool kit but it didn't take off the way I
first thought it would. I update this rarely (for now) but currently actively making into an actual program.


Combines basic ADB stuff with some advanced things as well like...
1. Change SELINUX to permissive
2. Sideload APKs to the Fire TV (not fully working)
3. Change(APP) install location
4. Root Verizon Galaxy S4 on mdk (OUTDATED)
5. Get unlock code for HTCDEV

By using this you agree to the following
    There is no warranty provided, if something goes wrong its on you.
